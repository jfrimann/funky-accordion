# funky-accordion
A simple and clean accordion with nice features.

Javascript/jquery is used to build the HTML from an xml structure. All transitions are CSS transitions.

##Instructions for use:
1. In your HTML file, link to the funkyaccordion.js, styles.css.
2. Make sure that you have linked you HTML to jQuery and Font Awsome.
3. If you want to use the font I have used, make sure to link to the Google font "Ubuntu".
4. In funkyaccordion.js, make sure that you point to the location of your xml file.
5. Don't change the structure of the xml file. You can add, delete and edit content though.
